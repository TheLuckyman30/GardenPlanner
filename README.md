# Verdantly Garden Planner

## Overview

Verdantly is a gardening assistant app designed to simplify plant care and garden planning for users of all experience levels. The app scans seed packets to extract planting information and combines it with data from the **Verdantly API** to provide accurate, personalized gardening advice.

Our goal is to help users plan, care for, and track their plants based on key factors such as environment, plant type, available space, water requirements, sunlight needs, and growth trends.

## Project Goals

The primary goals of this project are:

* **Seed Packet Scanning**
  Scan seed packets to automatically retrieve planting and care information.

* **Personalized Planting Advice**
  Use data from the Verdantly API to recommend optimal planting layouts and care strategies based on:

  * Environment
  * Plant type
  * Available space
  * Water requirements
  * Space requirements
  * Sunlight needs

* **Watering Reminders & Notifications**
  Provide timely reminders for watering plants. This feature was strongly supported by survey responses and is a core focus of the app.

* **Garden History & Trends**
  Include a history tab that allows users to track plant growth and view long-term trends.

* **Plant Sitter Instruction Sheets**
  Generate clear, shareable instruction sheets so users can easily communicate care instructions to plant sitters.

These goals have remained largely consistent since the original proposal. The **instruction sheet feature** was added after feedback from a group critique session.

## Evaluation Criteria

We will evaluate the success of this project by:

* Testing the **accuracy and reliability** of the planting and care information provided by the app
* Conducting **hands-on testing** of features such as scanning, reminders, and garden plotting
* Gathering feedback from **end users** to assess usability and usefulness

## Existing Solutions

While there are gardening apps with overlapping features, none of the researched solutions combine all of the following in one platform:

* Plant tracking
* Garden layout and plotting
* Notifications and timers
* Automatic garden plot generation

Verdantly aims to unify these features into a single, easy-to-use application.

## Target Users

### Novice Gardeners

Casual or beginner gardeners who may not know how to read seed packets or understand planting schedules. Verdantly helps them learn the basics, including:

* Planting seasons
* Watering schedules
* Light requirements
* General plant care

### Experienced Gardeners

Hobbyists who are highly invested in gardening and already understand plant care fundamentals. These users benefit from:

* Plant tracking
* Growth history
* Reduced manual effort for scheduling and organization

### Former Gardeners

Users who previously gardened but stopped due to specific pain points (e.g., time management, forgetfulness, complexity). Verdantly aims to address these issues and help them re-engage with gardening.

---

## Why These Users

We selected these target groups because Verdantly provides clear value to each:

* **Novice gardeners** gain guided learning and confidence
* **Experienced gardeners** save time and effort
* **Former gardeners** receive targeted support to overcome past frustrations

By addressing both educational and organizational needs, Verdantly makes gardening more accessible, efficient, and enjoyable for everyone.
